Global Citizenship Education Development (GCED) and the SustainableDevelopment Goals (SDGs) have become central themes in ethical research with refugee children, focusing onpromoting their agency and empowerment. This feeds into and drives my current PhD research, a continuation ofmy master’s work. Through participatory narrative projects, I engage refugee children as co-researchers inworkshops using tools like iPads for cellphilm, photovoice, artworks, and digital storytelling. This approach aims toempower them as future change-makers by enhancing the skills essential for 21st-century learning, such ascommunication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity. These children, having gained refugee experience, willbecome agents of change, promoting sustainable development goals by fostering adaptability, awareness andcompetency. </p>",
