          <p>
            <strong>Azam Dashti</strong>&nbsp;is a PhD candidate in the Faculty
            of Education at&nbsp;<strong>McGill University</strong>&nbsp;and
            a&nbsp;<strong>Digital Research Alliance of Canada Champion</strong
            >. An award‑winning&nbsp;<strong>FRQSC doctoral scholar</strong>,
            Through graduate coursework in machine learning and artificial
            intelligence, her doctoral research bridges disciplines to expose
            algorithmic bias in educational systems and foster 21st-century
            skills among marginalized children to make learning technologies
            more equitable.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;Azam is exploring co-leading
            the&nbsp;<strong>AI &amp; Justice</strong>&nbsp;stream at the
            Participatory Cultures Lab and
            founded&nbsp;<strong>ArtVoiceLab</strong>, a platform that elevates
            marginalized youth voices through cellphilming, photovoice, and data
            storytelling. Her current work investigates how design choices in
            adaptive learning platforms influence opportunities for marginalized
            learners and collaborates with school boards to translate evidence
            into policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously, Azam served as a curriculum specialist for
            UNESCO‑aligned sustainability‑education initiatives and contributed
            to a McGill&ndash;UQAM study on wellbeing through art‑based
            pedagogy. With 15 years of curriculum design and teaching experience
            across Iran and Canada, she also delivers workshops on AI literacy,
            open science, and digital storytelling for educators and graduate
            students.
          </p>

            &nbsp; I have extensive research experience in participatory,
            arts-based, and qualitative methodologies, particularly working with
            marginalized youth and refugee children. My research includes
            leading and co-facilitating projects involving&nbsp;<strong
              >cellphilming, photovoice, and digital storytelling</strong
            >, with a focus on social justice, equity, and ethical engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also received&nbsp;<strong
              >advanced training in qualitative methods research</strong
            >, including workshops in&nbsp;<strong
              >research methodology, NVivo, </strong
            >as well as&nbsp;<strong
              >graduate-level coursework in AI and machine learning</strong
            >&nbsp;to explore the intersection of digital research and
            education. Additionally, I have completed training in&nbsp;<strong
              >Research Data Management (RDM)</strong
            >&nbsp;and am currently engaged in digital infrastructure
            development and data ethics through my role as a&nbsp;<strong
