          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Azam Dashti Khavidaki</strong>&nbsp;is a PhD student in
            the&nbsp;<strong>Faculty of Education</strong>&nbsp;and
            a&nbsp;<strong>Digital Research Alliance of Canada</strong
            ><strong>Champion</strong>. She is the recipient of several
            prestigious scholarships and awards, including a PhD entrance
            scholarship from McGill University, an&nbsp;<strong
              >Fonds de recherche du Qu&eacute;bec &ndash; Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
              et culture</strong
            ><strong>(FRQSC)</strong>&nbsp;doctoral scholarship, a Digital
            Research Alliance of Canada award, and a Sustainability Education
            Fellowship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through advanced graduate training in machine learning, artificial
            intelligence, and digital research infrastructure, her doctoral
            research bridges education, policy, and technology to examine
            algorithmic bias, data governance, and ethical AI in educational
            systems. Combining technical expertise with participatory and
            sustainability-oriented research methods, she works to foster
            21st-century skills and advance more equitable, rights-respecting
            learning technologies for marginalized children and youth.
          </p>

            As a fellow at the Participatory Cultures Lab, Azam explores the
            intersections of AI and justice and
            co-founded&nbsp;<strong>ArtVoiceLab</strong>, a public-facing
            platform that amplifies marginalized youth voices through
            cellphilming, photovoice, and data storytelling. Her current work
            examines how design choices in adaptive and AI-driven learning
            platforms shape children&rsquo;s safety, data governance,
            algorithmic fairness, and future opportunities, and how this
            evidence can inform more ethical, equitable, and sustainable
            education policy and practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Azam contributed to a McGill&ndash;UQAM study on the Wellbeing
            project through art-based pedagogy. With 15 years of curriculum
            design and teaching experience across Iran and Canada, she also
            delivers workshops on AI literacy, open science, and digital
            storytelling for educators and graduate students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Azam earned an&nbsp;<strong>M.A. in Educational Leadership</strong

            Azam contributed to a McGill&ndash;UQAM project on
            the&nbsp;<em>Wellbeing</em>&nbsp;project through art-based pedagogy.
            She has extensive research experience in participatory, arts-based,
            and qualitative methodologies, particularly working with
            marginalized youth and refugee children. Her research includes
            leading and co-facilitating projects involving cellphilming,
            photovoice, and digital storytelling, with a focus on social
            justice, equity, and ethical engagement.
