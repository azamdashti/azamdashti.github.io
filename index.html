            How can we best empower children to meet the challenges of the 21st
            century? Global Citizenship Education Development (GCED) and the
            SustainableDevelopment Goals (SDGs) have become central themes in
            ethical research with refugee children, focusing onpromoting their
            agency and empowerment. This feeds into and drives my current PhD
            research, a continuation ofmy masterâ€™s work. Through participatory
            narrative projects, I engage refugee children as co-researchers
            inworkshops using tools like iPads for cellphilm, photovoice,
            artworks, and digital storytelling. This approach aims toempower
            them as future change-makers by enhancing the skills essential for
            21st-century learning, such ascommunication, collaboration, critical
            thinking, and creativity. These children, having gained refugee
            experience, willbecome agents of change, promoting sustainable
            development goals by fostering adaptability, awareness
            andcompetency.
